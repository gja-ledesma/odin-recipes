# odin-recipes
This repository is for the first project in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about). Simply click [here](https://neo-ran.github.io/odin-recipes/) to view the page.

By completing the project, I have demonstrated:
- The proper formatting and use of the elements and attributes that HTML have.
- Correct sourcing / linking of websites for showing images and making use of the `alt` attribute.
- Successful linking of _relative_ pages.
