# odin-recipes
This repository is for the first project and beyond as implied by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).  

**Current status as of 04-23-2022 : Building and completing `Project: Recipes`** 

## A short introduction: 

As I directly quote from the [project page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes):
> It’s time to put all of the HTML knowledge you have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website. 

This would be my first portfolio that I can present with the use of HTML. Because this is the first of the many more to come, this particular project can be personally described as my official start of something definite: a stable foundation. 

Once I complete this first project, I would have demonstrated:

- The proper formatting and use of the elements and attributes that HTML have.
- Correct sourcing of websites to show images and making use of the `alt` attribute.

Another note and I quote: 
> But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

This project will be modernized and improved as I progress in the coding curriculum; as a result, this repository will also get updated to reflect the improved foundation.
