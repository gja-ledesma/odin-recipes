## Introduction:
This would be my first portfolio that I can present involving HTML. Since this is the first of the many more portfolios to come, this particular project, for me, is the start of gradually building a strong foundation in web development. 

Once I have completed this first project, I would have demonstrated:

- The proper formatting and use of the elements and attributes that HTML have.
- Correct sourcing / linking of websites for showing images and making use of the `alt` attribute.
- Successful linking of _relative_ pages.
