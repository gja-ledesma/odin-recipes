# odin-recipes
This repository is for the first project (and, presumably, beyond) as per the curriculum for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).  

**Current status as of April 24th 2022: Completed `Project: Recipes`** 

## A short introduction: 

As I directly quote from the [project page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes):
> It’s time to put all of the HTML knowledge you have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website. 

This would be my first portfolio that I can present with the use of HTML. Since this is the first of the many more portfolios to come, this particular project, for me, is the start of something undeniably definite: the start of gradually building a strong foundation in web development. 

Once I complete this first project, I would have demonstrated:

- The proper formatting and use of the elements and attributes that HTML have.
- Correct sourcing / linking of websites for showing images and making use of the `alt` attribute.
- Successful linking of _relative_ pages.

Another note and I quote: 
> But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

This project will be modernized and improved as I progress the coding curriculum: 
- As a result, this repository (presumably) will also get updated to reflect the improved foundation. 

**Update**: a GitHub page for the (first) project is now up! Simply click [here](https://neo-ran.github.io/odin-recipes/) to view the page.
