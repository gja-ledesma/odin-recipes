# odin-recipes
This repository is for the first project as per the curriculum for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).  

## A short introduction:

As I directly quote from the [project page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes):
> Itâ€™s time to put all of the HTML knowledge you have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website. 

This would be my first portfolio that I can present involving HTML. Since this is the first of the many more portfolios to come, this particular project, for me, is the start of gradually building a strong foundation in web development. 

Once I complete this first project, I would have demonstrated:

- The proper formatting and use of the elements and attributes that HTML have.
- Correct sourcing / linking of websites for showing images and making use of the `alt` attribute.
- Successful linking of _relative_ pages.

## Update:
A GitHub page for the first project is now up! Simply click [here](https://neo-ran.github.io/odin-recipes/) to view the page.
