<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Position the oven racks in the center and lower third of the oven. 
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill a roasting pan halfway with water and place in the lower rack in the oven. 
        Spray the inside of a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <br>
    <li>Beat three 8-ounce packages cream cheese in a bowl using an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy; reduce speed to medium-low. 
        Add white sugar and beat 2 minutes. Beat 4 eggs, 1 at a time, into cream cheese mixture, beating well before adding the next egg. 
        Beat sour cream and vanilla extract into cream cheese mixture until smooth; add 3 tablespoons flour and beat until cheesecake mixture is smooth.</li>
        <br>
    <li>Beat brown sugar and canola oil together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. 
        Add 1 egg and beat for 2 minutes; reduce speed to low. Add 1 cup flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt and beat until batter is combined. 
        Fold carrots and walnuts into batter.</li>
        <br>
    <li>Spread carrot cake batter in the prepared pan; top with cheesecake mixture. 
        Place pan on the rack above the roasting pan with water in the oven.</li>
        <br>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is set, about 1 hour 10 minutes, 
        covering top of pan with aluminum foil if browning too quickly. Cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <br>
    <li>Run a knife around the edge of pan to loosen cake; cool to room temperature in pan on a wire rack. 
        Refrigerate at least 8 hours. Remove the outside of the springform pan.</li>
        <br>
    <li>Beat confectioners' sugar, 4 ounces cream cheese, and almond extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until frosting is smooth. 
        Spread frosting on top of cheesecake layer.</li>
